Python 2.7 or 3.5+ Version of the Single Molecule Translation Simulator (MatLab) by Dr. Luis Aguilera

Translated by Will Raymond - Summer 2018

# rSNAPsim

#### Project Goal

Provide a Python module that takes nucleotide sequence as an input and does the following: 
   * Choose a file or pull a file from GeneBank
   * Analyzes the sequence and identifies proteins 
   * Detects or adds fluorescent tags
   * Simulates translation trajectories and converts to intensity vectors of A.U. under various conditions
      * Constructs with Rare codons only or Common codons, FRAP or Harringtonite assays
   * Provides analyses of the trajectories 
   * Allows the user to save or export the data
   * Commandline / GUI implementations

#### Documentation

Dependencies: 
 * NumPy 
 * SciPy
 * BioPython
 * matplotlib

#### Instillation
